				<h3>Himpunan Mahasiswa Elektro Website</h3>
				<p>I was assigned by my Departement leader in communication and Informations Departement, for created a website for this organization. Back to 2015, this organization was had a blog, but not updated. I was created a website hme-pnj.com, from download a blog template, then I was modified HTML and CSS code for created and update this website. My teammates also created back-end programming with PHP language and CPanel. I was collaborated for maintained this website from January 2016 until May 2016.</p>

				<h3>Adobe Illustrator Icon Portfolio</h3>
				<p>I was created my first icon, "Icon Kita" for my classmate team project, Mid Term Exam lectures "Entrepreneurship", in my last semester in Poltek UI. This icon illustrates my team product, a halthy juice with jeruk nipis as the icon for symbolize healthy because this fruit contains vitamin B1, B2, B3 carbohydrate, calium sugar, and iron. Then I used snows as symbol for fresh, because a healthy juice is not only healthy, but is refreshing. While I was created this project, I had learned many things about Adobe Illustrator. </p>

				<h3>Izmilia's Front-End Website</h3>
				<p>This is my second project where I used HTML5 and CSS3. In this website there are 3 menu tabs such as Home, About Me, and Portfolio. At Home menu, user can see a showcase text "Affordable Professional Front-End Developer". Which means I can provide a professional website for user, if user want to subscribe information about website trend, just fill the subscribe form below the text Subscribe to my website, for more high quality front-end websites. Then in About Me menu, user could see my former organization life in my campus, Politeknik Universitas Indonesia. The last menu, Portfolio, resembles my three projects in front-end areas, such as web design and blogging, design icon with a software, and front-end programming portfolio. I hope my projects could contribute for PT.Stampindo Lancar Jaya success.</p>
